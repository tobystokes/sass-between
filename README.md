# sass-between

Sass library for fluid sizing between breakpoints

DEPRECATED: Natively supported by css viewport-relative units and clamp() these days.

## Usage

- npm install `sass-between`
- `@import "sass-between";` or
- copy `dist/_between.scss` to somewhere else to import.
- add `--load-path=node_modules` to sass command line, or equivalent bundler config.
- Replace default variables:

```
$between-min: 360px;
$between-max: 1200px;
$between-dimension: width;
```
